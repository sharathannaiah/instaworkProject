# instaworkProject

Download/clone the project and Open or import it using any IDE(I used Eclipse) as a Maven Project.
Then refresh the project so that it downloads all the dependencies required. 
To execute the project Right click on the TestNG.xml file which you can find in the project code and run as TestNG suite.
You can see the execution results in the console. You can also view the output results in the test-output folder by clicking on the emailable-report.html.
